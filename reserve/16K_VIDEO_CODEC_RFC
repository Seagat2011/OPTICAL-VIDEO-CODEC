The following is a Request For Comment (RFC) for a proposed encoding scheme which encodes any 16K image or video frame using a method known as RE encapsulation.
RE encapsulation is a well-known method of string-matching, known to those skilled in the art. This RFC attempts to employ an RE encapsulation method to frame encoding.
Code examples are demonstrated using pseudo code or ECMA-262 JAVASCRIPT

The proposed method is explained herein:

RULE
1. A byte or bit is called a pattern
2. All tables reside in Read/Write memory
3. Saved values for CLOCK must be accessible in both binary and integer form

PROCEDURE (16K ENCODING)
1. copy every byte or bit into a table,P[]
2. create an N-bit clock,CLOCK,having a sufficient resolution to reach every pattern,P[CLOCK],in the table P[]
3. create another temporary hash table,16K_STRING[],to be used as a condensing library
4. starting from CLOCK equal 0 at the beginning of table,P[],until end-of-table:
  1. check if the pattern,P[CLOCK],already exists in the table,16K_STRING[],and
    a. If the pattern,P[CLOCK],does not exist in the table,16K_STRING[]:
       - add the pattern,P[CLOCK],to the table,and create another empty hash sub table inside it: 16K_STRING_SUBPATTERN[] 
         (eg. 16K_STRING[ P[CLOCK] ] = new 16K_STRING_SUBPATTERN[]) ; or
    b. If the pattern,P[CLOCK],does indeed exist in the table,16K_STRING[], 
      save the CLOCK & the pattern,P[CLOCK],in the hash sub table 16K_STRING_SUBPATTERN[]. (eg 16K_STRING[ P[CLOCK] ].push(CLOCK) )
  2. loop to next pattern in P[] (ie. add 1 to CLOCK)
5. stop at end-of-file (table)
6. save final resolution (#bits required for the clock) into variable,LENGTH
  
At this point we have built a pattern table where each clock value will generate a specific pattern.
Now lets examine one of the sub patterns in 16K_STRING_SUBPATTERN[]
Let say, for example, a 1-bit pattern was generated at the following clock values for the file

1: 100|1100|11100|111100|1111100|11111100
    
A lookup table will return the equivalent Regular Expression: /^1+00$/

All RE (Regular Expression) patterns are distilled in the hash lookup table: 16K_RegExp_string[]

We have now seen how to encode an N-bit clock


PROCEDURE (16K DECODING)
1. extract one RE pattern,RE,from a saved table,P[]
2. extract one pattern,PATTERN,from P[ RE[] ]
3. create an N-bit clock,CLOCK,specified by the variable,LENGTH,having a sufficient resolution to generate every required pattern,P[ RE[CLOCK] ],in the table P[ RE[] ]
4. create another temporary hash table,16K_STRING[],to be used as an image buffer
5. starting from CLOCK equal 0 at the beginning of table,P[ RE[] ],until end-of-table:
  1. check if the pattern,CLOCK,matches,P[ RE[CLOCK] ],as binary,and
    a. If the pattern,P[ RE[CLOCK] ],does not match CLOCK, then loop to next CLOCK (ie. add 1 to CLOCK); or
    b. If the pattern,P[ RE[CLOCK] ],does indeed match CLOCK, then 
      write the value of PATTERN & CLOCK into the image buffer 16K_STRING. (eg 16K_STRING[ CLOCK ] = PATTERN )
  2. repeat from step 1 until end of CLOCK
6. loop to next RE pattern in P[]
7. send image 16K_STRING to frame buffer


RE patterns may be decoded in sequence or in parallel. On average, compression ratios per bit are greater than 1000:1
